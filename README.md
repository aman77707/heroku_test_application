# OnlineKart E-commerce

## Motivation:
  Motivattion for the project came from the idea of creating a basic and sample proof of concept for the      
  online shopping platform. Though the project has missing front-end and is under the scope of enormous     
  improvement it has definitely achored me at a position from where I can take this project from a sample   
  POC to a completely built working website as an e-commerce platform.  

## Dependencies and hosting instructions:
### Carry out the following steps:
  * Once, the repository has been cloned in a local environment, navigate to the repository root which contains  
    requirements.txt file and execute:  
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```  
  * After installing the dependencies, set flask variable FLASK_APP. To do this execute the below command:  
    ```
    export FLASK_APP=api.py
    ```
  * Set the environment variables by running the command:  
    ```
    source setup.sh
    ```
  * To run the server, run:  
    ```
    flask run --reload
    ```

  Post starting the server, we are in position to start sending requests to the end points hosted on the URL.
