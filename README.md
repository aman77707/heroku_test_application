# OnlineKart E-commerce

## Motivation:
  Motivattion for the project came from the idea of creating a basic and sample proof of concept for the      
  online shopping platform. Though the project has missing front-end and is under the scope of enormous     
  improvement. Also, project has achored me at position from where I can take this project from a sample   
  POC to a completely built working website as an e-commerce platform.
